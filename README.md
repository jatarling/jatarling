- 👋 Hi, I’m @jatarling
- 👀 I’m interested in AWS and learning to code in Python!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python using Python for Everybody (a brilliant free course) and AWS Solutions Architect Associate using Stephane Maarek's course.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help bring me up to speed regarding Python/cloud computing.

- 😁 My background is coding in RPG up until 2002 when I changed careers, bought up my children and took a degree in Nutritional Medicine.
- 💖 I love hiking, mountain biking, (teaching Pilates - yes I'm an instructor), body boarding, open water swimming (a beginner), and to relax I like reading.
